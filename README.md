# Lorebranch
A little app designed to make the process of managing a story easier (ideally).

By using a tree of nodes, character sheets, and story events that link the two together; LoreBranch aims to simplify a lot of the headache that comes with tracking places, events, and relationships in larger-scale worldbuilding. It was also built with basic tabletop game structure in mind, though at a bare minimum level.

**DISCLAIMER**
There is a decent amount of code in this project that has been generated and/or refactored by Claude.
Over time, I'm hoping to dramatically reduce this amount as I clean up feature implementation.
At the moment, this app is considered a personal-use project, and therefore lacks the integrity & polish I'd demand of something more public & open.
If you somehow stumble across this and would like to contribute to it, be my guest.
